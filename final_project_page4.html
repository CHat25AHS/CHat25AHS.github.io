  <h2>What Kind of Education Options are there?</h2>
  <p>Education options may vary depending on the position you are looking for. You may go to a 4 year college if you want the best chance at getting into other jobs or you are a little unsure if this is what you want so you could change your major if needed. A tech college is great for if you are set on graphic design because the classes will be a lot more specifically tailored to graphic design itself. Another option is to go into an apprenticship where you will get  paid to do hands on work while you are being taught by a company that decides to take you in. They may even help with college benefits if you would like to do an apprenticship and college education at the same time.</p>
