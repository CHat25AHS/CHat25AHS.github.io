    <h2>What is Graphic Design?</h2>
    <p class="hpbody">Graphic Design is the art of arranging text and pictures to design for a specific purpose. The intention of the design can vary from personal use images to full on advertisement campaigns. I have created this website to inform about the different aspects of graphic design. These aspects include the different types of media you may prodcue, advertising and it's relation to graphic design, jobs and careers in the field of graphic design, education options, and related fields. I made this to help spread information about one of my passions and I hope you learn something today.</p>
