    <h3>What is Esports?</h3>
    <p>
        Esports are multiplayer online games played on a <em>competitive</em> level, often times for spectators to watch. For example, some Esports played in Altoona are Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. On a school level, competitions are played versus other schools and schools can have multiple teams to account for multiple students. The site that Altoona High School (AHS) uses for their Esports is PlayVS, this helps keep track of teams, who we are competing against, and more! The schools you are playing are split up by region, Centeral, Eastern, and Pacific are the regions for the US area.

    <h3>How are Competitions Played?</h3>
    <h4>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</h4>
    <p>
        Super Smaash Bros Ultimate competitions go as follows, you play a best of 5 sets with 3 players on each team. For the each set, each team will  send in their first player, you will go through a process of confirming your character and selecting stages through stage striking. After that the selected players will play a match, each player gets 3 lives each round and after each round, you will report the winner. Each set requires a best of 3 rounds and after you are done, the next player on your team fights another player from the other team. Each set continues like that until one team wins 3 sets.
    </p>
    <h4>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</h4>
    <p>
        Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a very different game than Super Smash Bros Ultimate, so it requires a different rules set. Teams will play a best of 3 sets, with each set containg 6 races. The winner of each set is decided by which team has the most points at the end of the 6 races. Each team has 4 racers and everyone has to select random tracks, the game rules must be set to normal items and a team game. The first team to win 2 sets will win the competition.
